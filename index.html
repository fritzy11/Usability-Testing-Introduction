My immediate family didn't have too much influence on my college decisions (most of that came from my high school classes), but my mom is definitely responsible for my interests in UX design, usability, and human decision making due to her job as a web designer.</h2>

I have been playing soccer since I was 3 years old, and played all the way until I graduated highschool. I just play intramurals and pickup now, but still love to watch and play the game. My obsession with Mike and Ikes is very random, but for some reason they are by far my favorite candy, and I often have a 1.8 pound bag in my room. I also love trying to think about human decision making. I a firm believer that everything people do is done for a reason, and trying to figure out what that reason may be in myself or others is something I do often.</h2>

         <h1>Where do you want your knowledge and skills to take you?</h1>
  <h2>Considering I'm not sure what kind of engineering discipline I want to pursue, I'm not sure what exactly my career in engineering will look like, but I hope it is more hands-on and in the field because making things hands-on is why I chose to major in engineering. However, if engineering doesn't work out for me I would like to go to law school and pursue a career of being a patent lawyer. My interest in this comes from my Dad constantly telling me I'd be a good lawyer and from a debate class I took in high school that was one of my favorite classes ever. Being an engineer is important to me because I want to make a difference in the world and create products that are more accessible and thoughtful of peoples' needs. Being a patent lawyer is also important to me because I want to own my own company one day that releases more accessible and thoughtful products, so having knowledge about patent law would be advantageous to protecting the rights to my inventions.</h2>
